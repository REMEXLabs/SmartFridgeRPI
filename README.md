# SmartFridgeRPI

Application wich gets installed on the Raspberry PI of the Smartfridge.

The functionalities are:
- keeps track of sensor changes (e.g. door was opened)
- takes a picture of the inside of the fridge when the door was opened
- sends the picture to the webserver
- listens to the barcode scanner
- gets the product information of a barcode from the internet
- sends the gathered product information via push notification to the Andorid application

## Installation

Java has to be installed:

    Java -version
    apt-get install oracle-java7-jdk


In order to ensure the access of the server application to the GPIO pins, WiringPI must be installed. You must first install Git: 

    sudo apt-get install git-core

Now the git repository of WiringPi can be cloned: 

    git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi

Afterwards, WiringPI has to be installed, change it with the help of the terminal into the folder into which WiringPi was cloned and start the installation: 

    cd wiringPi ./build

To ensure that the connected camera is detected, the fswebcam software package must be installed: 

    sudo apt-get install fswebcam

To create the Database, MySql must be installed: 

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Before the database image can be imported, a database with the name fridgedb_rpi must be created and selected: 

    mysql -u root -p 
Enter password: 

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE fridgedb_rpi mysql> USE fridgedb_rpi

Now the database image can be imported: 

    $ mysql -u root -p fridgedb_rpi < fridgedb_rpi.sql

In order for the server application to run automatically after a restart of the Raspberry, a file with the name startup.desktop must be created in the `/ etc / xdg /` autostart directory. 

Make sure the `FridgeServer.jar` is on the desktop, or adjust the path below.
Enter the following code lines into the file: 

    [Desktop Entry] Type=Application Name=ServerApplication Exec = gksu „sudo java – jar /home/pi/Desktop/FridgeServer.jar“

If gksu has never been executed on the RPI, call the following command once in the terminal: 

    gksu „sudo java – jar /home/pi/Desktop/FridgeServer.jar“

Gksu will now ask you for root access, please confirm this.
